## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KarimAbboud](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KarimAbboud)


**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KarimAbboud/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Created and deployed a Linux cluster monitoring agent built on a Docker-contained PostgreSQL database to perform data analysis about node performance. Developed a bash script to automate creating/starting/stopping the PSQL Docker container based on arguments to the script. Automated the creation of PSQL database tables using a custom DDL script. Developed shell scripts to connect to the PSQL database and populate tables using Linux hardware monitoring commands. Automated the collection of node usage data on a one-minute interval using crontab. Built and manually tested the app in a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provisioned virtual machine using Rocky Linux 9 as the operating system.

**Core Java Grep App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KarimAbboud/tree/master/core_java/grep)]: Developed a Java application that mimics the functionality of Linux's native Grep command to recursively search files and directories to locate matches for a user-provided phrase or regular expression. Utilized the standard Maven directory layout in the process of building the application. Deployed the application using a Docker container built by an image available through Docker Hub. Manually tested the application by comparing its output to the results of Linux's grep command given the same starting directory and search parameters.

**MongoDB Spring Boot Insurance App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KarimAbboud/tree/master/insurance-mongo)]: Developed a Spring Boot API to interface with a car insurance database storing information about people and their vehicle ownership. This API features several custom-built calls to MongoDB queries and aggregations to retrieve relevant business data regarding potential customers. The application is built using Java and the standard Maven directory layout. Postman was used in the process of manual testing to send HTTP requests and verify the efficacy of API calls.

**Power BI Dashboards** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_KarimAbboud/tree/master/power_bi)]: Constructed three Power BI dashboards, graphically depicting three sets of data. The beverage dashboard visualized a dataset describing the sales of various well-known beverage brands and their respective products in the United States. Another dashboard served as a report of data from a survey targeted at data professionals regarding their past education, experience, difficulty breaking into the industry, general happiness in their role, and the factors motivating them to seek new employment. The last dashboard visualized data pulled from the Alpha Vantage API, showcasing at-a-glance information on the current value of a particular user-chosen stock and its historical trends.


## Highlighted Projects
**Financial Management System**: Worked with an agile team operated through ZenHub to develop a financial management system with a custom GUI built using Java's JFrame class. Participated in stand-ups, sprints, task estimations, and retrospectives. Developed functionality allowing for invoice, receipt, and income source logging. Built functionality to aggregate user-provided data into a balance sheet or income statement. Built the automated testing portion of the projects CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to verify commits to the GitHub repository maintained project functionality.

**Replica World of Warcraft Database**: Constructed an ER diagram to model the structure of a World of Warcraft user account database. Built database through SQL statements using Oracle SQL Developer. Deployed database through Docker to provide an isolated testing environment and compatibility across multiple workstations.

**Custom Language Interpreter**: Built and manually tested an interpreter for a custom programming language template using Java and Java Compiler Compiler (JavaCC). Provided variable and method functionality using Java's HashMap class to create a symbol table for storing variable information. Implemented call stack functionality into the language using Java's Stack class to simulate operation through multiple nested subroutines.
